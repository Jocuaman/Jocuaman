### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

Lab 3, Part 2 was one of my favorites as it was one of the first thought-provoking labs that we had done. It taught me about one of many ways that we can utilize code to solve problems - in this case, the difference in two different dates - that may come up in any future software or program.

* Lab 6

Lab 6, Part 2 was interesting to me as Blackjack is just one of many examples of how code can give someone the advantage when it comes to creating a functional program. This lab felt more specific and therefore personal, as we had finally gotten into the territory of coding where we must consider constantly-changing variables and possibilities as a programmer.

* Lab 7

Lab 7, Part 2 was quite possibly my favorite lab so far this semester. Yet another common problem that many people experience, having to deal with the conditions under which an individual may or may not park depending on the location, time of day, and hour was thrilling. In this case, we had gotten to practice the use of if and else statements, as well as the application of several variables that go into the outcome of a function.
